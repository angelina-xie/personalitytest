    <h1>SCUAI</h1>
    <div class="description">
          You are a chill person with a good sense of humor (proficient in sarcasm). People tend to like you, and you don't like to take sides cause you don't care about arguments all that much. Some other SCUAI's are Jim from the Office and Sans from Undertale.
